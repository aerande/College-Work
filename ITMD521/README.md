ITM Private Repo for Aniruddha Erande

Hi All,

I am Aniruddha Erande from Gujarat, India. I did my bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering. I have experience of about 2 years in Infosys Ltd. where I worked QA engineer.

I have a dire interest in learning more and more about Data Analysis. Apart from that, I know programming languages like Java, Python, HTML, C# on an intermediate level, and also tools and technologies used in QA interests me a lot.

My hobbies are to play soccer, table tennis and listen to music.
