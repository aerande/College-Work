### **1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability, and control.**

  * Iaas - It is known as Infrastructure as a Service. It consists of computer and network hardware, real or virtual, and is build for operators who are looking to build their own platforms. Cost wise IaaS is costliest than PaaS & SaaS.
  * PaaS - It is known as Platform as a Service. It provides a base to run our software in a framework that is provided by third-party vendors. It costs less than IaaS.
  * SaaS - It is known as Software as a Service. It works an application or a website on the customer end. It is the cost-effective platform of all.

### **2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service?**

  * SaaS is an application or a website that is accessed by customers from anywhere. Here anywhere means from any part of the world, and from any device - computer or mobile. So, there is always a risk of security, that the system might get hacked.
  * It is a self-service kind of portal where customers don't need permission to accessing the service, like signing up and leaving the service to move to a better competitor. So, there will ups and downs in the customer count.
  * Many SaaS services are often upgraded frequently. So, the customers should be provided some kind of mechanism to move to the next release.

### **3. List the key advantages of virtual machines.**

  * Virtual machines make computing more efficient. When the computer power of a physical machine is divided into the virtual machines, it can help reduce stranded capacity by assigning right size for their requirements.
  * By using virtual machines, an organizational structure can be followed among different departments within an organization. If they want to have sufficient cross-department billing options, then having them by using virtual machine can help a lot.
  * Sometimes virtual machines are advantageous logistically. If running five services on a single machine, then any OS patches or upgrades are to be approved by all the services. But if each service is installed on different virtual machines, then patches can be done on different schedules for different services.

### **4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines?**

  * CPU cores are always shared within a system. For example, if a physical has a four-core CPU, and two virtual machines each sharing three virtual cores, then Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) load-balances these six virtual cores on four physical cores. Now when a virtual machine is ideal, then only three virtual cores are working, and if both the virtual machines are working with great processing power, then they will run slowly as load-balancing capacity will hinder.
  * There is no bound in shared resources among the virtual machines. If a virtual machine is generating a huge amount of network traffic, then the other machines may suffer.
  * Virtual machines are heavy-weight. They take on the full disk space, and run on the full operating system. They hold all the memory allocated to them. 

### **5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services?**

  * The business decision to choose private over public cloud services depends on these four factors:
    - *Compliance* - Every company follows a compliance with all applicable regulations, and these compliances can be audited. If a company providing private cloud services fails the audit, then the company cannot run until they pass the audit. For a company providing public cloud services, if they fail the audit, they lose their customers.
    - *Privacy* - Using public cloud service, every customers data and code depend on third-party equipment, residing in someone else's facility. There is a risk of losing data, and therefore privacy.
    - *Cost* - Using private cloud services, although the initial cost of setting the whole environment is typically high, but keeping in mind the long term concept, it is cost-effective as the company will have more and more customers as the time passes.
    - *Control* - If a company sets up a private cloud service, then they have the full control of whatever specifications they need to set. Unlike public cloud services, the company has to depend on the thrid-party vendor's hardware configuration.

### **6. Which selection strategy does your current organization use? What are the benefits and caveats of using this strategy?**

  * The previous organization where I worked used the 'Get started quickly' strategy.
  * The advantage of using this strategy is that the companies are tend to start their cloud services as fast as possible, no matter what the cost might be.
  * It is cost-effective if the company builds its own infrastructure, rather than contracting with public cloud provider. But building this infrastructure will take longer time, maybe years, to develop.
