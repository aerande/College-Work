### **1. What are the major sources of failure in distributed computing systems?**

  * 

### **2. What are the most common failures: software, hardware, or human? Justify your answer.**

  * 

### **3. Select one resiliency technique and give an example of a failure and the way in which the resiliency technique would prevent a user-visible outage. Do this for one technique in each of these sections: 6.5, 6.6, 6.7,and 6.8.**

  * 

### **4. If a load balancer is being used, the system is automatically scalable and resilient. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Justify your answer.**

  * 

### **5. Which resiliency techniques or technologies are in use in your environment?**

  * 

### **6. Where would you like to add resiliency in your current environment? Describe what you would change and which techniques you would apply.**

  * 

### **7. In your environment, give an example of graceful degradation under load, or explain how you would implement it if it doesn’t currently exist.**

  * 

### **8. How big can a RAID5 array be? For example, how large can it be before the parity checking scheme is likely to miss an error? How long can the rebuild time be before MTBF puts the system at risk of a second failure?**

  * 

### **9. The phrase “Eat right. Exercise. Die anyway.” is mentioned on page 123. Explain how this relates to distributed computing.**
